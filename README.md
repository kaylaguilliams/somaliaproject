# As climate change looms, Somalian's fear for their livelihood. 

In October 2019, Somalia experienced a flood at the hands of climate change. As the country with the second lowest GDP per capita in the world, when these climate disasters strike, they lack the resources to recover. In addition, the country's GDP is 60.2% dependent on agriculture- an industry that is highly sensitive to climate impacts. 

I analyzed and visualized data from the World Bank to understand global trends regarding GDP, percent of GDP from agriculture, and climate vulnerability for each country. In my analysis, I found that, worldwide, the countries that are the most vulnerable to climate disaster are those with the lowest GDPs.

I also found that while GDP per capita alone gives a good indication of which countries are most vulnerable to climate change, zooming in on the percent of a country’s GDP that comes from agriculture explains 58% of a country’s vulnerability score, and there’s a strong correlation between the two indicators.
