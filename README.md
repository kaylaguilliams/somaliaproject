# As climate change looms, Somalian's fear for their livelihood. 
In October 2019, Somalia experienced a flood at the hands of climate change. As the country with the second lowest GDP per capita in the world, when these climate disasters strike, they lack the resources to recover. 
In my data analysis of GDP, percent of GDP from agriculture, and climate vulnerability for each country, I found that this is a trend seen around the world - the countries that are the most vulnerable to climate disaster are those with the lowest GDPs, givingthem less capacity to recover from disaster. 
In my analysis I also found that while GDP per capita alone gives a good indication of which countries are mostvulnerable to climate change, zooming in on where this GDP comes from gives an even better indication. According to data from the World Bank, the percent of a country’s GDP that comes from agriculture explains 58% of a country’s vulnerability score, and there’s a strong correlationbetween the two indicators.
